a=5.0
b=3.0

#Addition
print "Sum of %d and %d is %d" %(a, b , a+b)
#Output : Sum of 5 and 3 is 8

#Subtraction
print "Difference of %d and %d is %d" %(a,b,a-b)
#Output : Difference of 5 and 3 is 2

#Multiplication
print "Product of %d and %d is %d" %(a,b,a*b)
#Output : Product of 5 and 3 is 15

#Divison
print "%d divided by %d is %f" %(a,b,a/b)
#Output : 5 divided by 3 is 1.666667

#Remainder Operation
print "Remainder of %d divided by %d is %d" %(a,b,a%b)
#Oputput : Remainder of 5 divided by 3 is 2

#Power
print "%d raise to the power %d is %d" %(a,b,a**b)
#Output : 5 raise to the power 3 is 125
